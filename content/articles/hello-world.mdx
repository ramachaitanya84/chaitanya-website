# Hello World

Welcome to my personal website. This is a sample article written in **MDX** — you can mix Markdown with React components.

## What's Next?

This site is built with:

- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **MDX** for content

The architecture is designed for future AI integration, including a RAG-based chat interface that will answer questions about my work and experience.

## Getting Started

To add more articles, simply create a new `.mdx` file in `content/articles/` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Title"
date: "2025-02-22"
excerpt: "Brief description"
slug: "your-slug"
---
```

Then write your content in Markdown (or MDX) below the frontmatter.
